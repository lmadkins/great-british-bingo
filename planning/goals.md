MVP:
Mobile and tablet first!

elements/components
- welcome message at start, with instructions, button to start 
- button to restart game (out of reach of accidental press)
- header with name of game
- message to display if win
- bingo card- 3x3 grid, free in center

if selected/marked off maybe fade background or some other css effect slightly to indicate not an option?

load new game on render
- on click of open page
- shuffled each time restart
- each slot can only appear once per game

- interactivity with clicks
- crossed off but visible

Check win
- display message when win, offer to play again
- if get three in a row, horizontally or vertically, win game


STRETCH
- in-game instructions (tooltip on hover/click?)
- on check win, modal or other effect instead of alert
- different UI for desktop view
- multiplayer options?
- options for hosts/sandy/noel/prue/paul
